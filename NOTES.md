I’m on the $200 a month Claude plan and personally I haven’t felt like I needed anything else. I use regular VS code so cursor isn’t necessary and then just have the Claude CLI tool directly in my terminal. 
--Then I just use planning mode inside of the Claude instance if I ever need to research anything so perplexity didn’t seem to be worth it for me either. 
--I don't use any auto completes when I code. I'm either fully working alongside the ai assistent or hand typing any changes I want to make. If you find yourself using that very often then it could justify the $20 a month for cursor imo. 
--Also I'll add that the $200 a month tier is pretty overkill for me, so your current claude tier should be plenty unless you're genuinely doing heavily assisted coding for 10 hours a day. I'll likely be downgrading to the $100 once this month runs out.

Cursor Pro $20 subscription
I usually use Auto Mode to stay within budget. 
Sometimes I decide to use OPUS 4.5.
--I have the Codex extension installed as well, this uses my $20 ChatGPT subscription, so I'll swap to GPT-5.2-Codex or GPT-5.1-Codex-MAX both with HIGH reasoning.

I canceled my Cursor subscription and now I think I'm using Google AI Pro. But my main ide now is Google Antigravity instead of Cursor for personal projects.
--I still use Cursor for work, but not for personal use just cause it's way more expensive than using Google Antigravity.

Claude Code: $20
Windsurf: $10 (Ever since I use claude + google ai studio I almost stopped using this
Google AI Pro: $20

--Google AI Pro, googles AI suite is huge. I use Google AI Studio to get a basic MVP for any idea I get. Then I download the app that was output by Google AI Studio and drop it into an directory. Next to that directory I add my own project where I want all the features to be transfered. Then I ask Claude Code to EXACTLY copy every feature into my own directory, all while respecting the directory structure and code quality of the code thats already there. That's how I ship features to clients or my own projects now.
--I've gotten rid of ChatGPT, because ChatGPT had long reset rates, versus Claude resets every 4 hours i think which is nice.

--Windsurf - I use this for coding, it's an alternative to cursor. Gives me a selection of models and new features come out constantly. Happy with how it works and I got the early adopter pricing for just $10/mo.
--Superwhisper - Using this for speech to text. Happy with it especially compared to Wispr Flow for these reasons: it is stable on my m2 mac mini unlike Wispr, it is half the price, and it has text post processing using an LLM prompt (lowercase text in discord for example). Only paying $6/mo for it.

Perplexity @ $20/mo for research, and honestly become my main search engine
Cursor @ $20/mo was using Sonnet 4 w/ up to $30 extra usage, but might pivot to Claude Code and just keep this for tab complete.
Claude Max @ $100/mo - trying this out this month. Probably expensive but I have heard great reviews on Opus 4. This is 99% used for me in Claude Code.
